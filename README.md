## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to learn about CSS-Frameworks. We were supposed to do this using Bootstrap and Sass, but in the course we also had a section where we could learn about using tailwindcss aswell. After looking more closely at the different css frameworks I found that I liked tailwindCSS the most and it was something I could see myself using in my future projects. So I requested to use this instead of bootstrap/sass.
